          Here is a detailed explanation of the practical ways our platform helps your business utilize its five core features:        </p>

    <div className="usecase-left">
      <h3>Maximizing Success Rates</h3>
    </div>
    <div className="usecase-right">
      <p>
        An e-commerce site processes a transaction. If the primary payment gateway declines the card 
        (e.g., due to temporary server issues or bank restrictions), our smart <strong>Route engine</strong> 
        instantly and automatically re-routes the transaction to a secondary or tertiary gateway, 
        ensuring the sale is completed.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div className="usecase-card">
    <div className="usecase-left">
      <h3>Cost Optimization</h3>
    </div>
    <div className="usecase-right">
      <p>
        If your business operates in multiple regions, Route can be configured to prioritize the 
        processor with the <strong>lowest transaction fees</strong> for payments originating from specific 
        countries or using certain card types, thereby reducing your overall operational costs.
      </p>
    </div>

  <div className="usecase-card">
    <div className="usecase-left">
      <h3>Load Balancing & Latency</h3>
    </div>
    <div className="usecase-right">
      <p>
        During high-traffic events (like a major flash sale), Route distributes transaction volume 
        across multiple gateways to prevent any single one from being overwhelmed, maintaining 
        <strong> lightning-fast checkout times</strong> and avoiding system failure.
      </p>

  <div className="usecase-card">
    <div className="usecase-left">
      <h3>Compliance Management</h3>
    </div>
    <div className="usecase-right">
      <p>
        For businesses operating globally, Route ensures that payments from specific countries are 
        channeled only through gateways that <strong>comply with local regulatory standards</strong> 
        (e.g., GDPR, PSD2), significantly reducing your legal risk.

        drastically accelerating payment time.

      <h3>Subscription/Recurring Billing</h3>
    </div>
    <div className="usecase-right">
      <p>
        If your SaaS company uses recurring billing, our system automatically
        generates and sends invoices to subscribers every month and tracks
        which ones are overdue, eliminating manual follow-up.

      <h3>Integrated Tracking</h3>
    </div>
    <div className="usecase-right">
      <p>
        When an invoice is sent, our system automatically marks it as "Sent."
        When the payment link is clicked, it becomes "Viewed," and once paid,
        it updates to "Paid." This provides you with a real-time dashboard view
        of outstanding receivables.
